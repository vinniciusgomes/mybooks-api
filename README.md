## MyBooks API Documentation

### Introduction
Welcome to the documentation for the MyBooks API. MyBooks is a SaaS project designed to help users organize their personal library. This API provides endpoints for managing libraries, books, user profiles, billing, loan status, and reading status.

- `POST v1/subscribe`: Subscribe to a plan.

### Loan

#### Endpoints:
- `POST v1/loans`: Create a loan
- `GET v1/loans`: Get all loans
- `PUT v1/loans/:loanId/return`: Mark loan as returned

### Reading Status

### Running Locally
To run the service locally, you can use [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) for hot-reloading. Run the following command:
```
air
```

### Running in Production with Docker
To run the service in a production environment using Docker, follow these steps:
1. Build the Docker image:
```
docker build --tag mybooks .
```
2. Run the Docker container, mapping port 8080 on your local machine to port 8080 in the container:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 mybooks
```

Now you should have the MyBooks API service up and running locally or in a production environment.
